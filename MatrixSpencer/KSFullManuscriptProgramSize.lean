# Polynomial size of the concrete SDP reduction

For physical complex dimension `d`, the actual affine pencil has `4d²-1`
real variables and a single real PSD constraint of order `10d`. A bisection
feasibility query adds one affine objective halfspace. The complete dense
pencil data (constant and one coefficient matrix per variable) has exactly
`400d⁴` real entries, excluding the objective vector and scalar threshold.
These are sizes of the actual pencil used by the verified report. A
polynomial-time convex-program solver may be assumed under the user's
chosen runtime scope; no solver-runtime axiom is added to Lean.
